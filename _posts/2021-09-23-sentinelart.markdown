## Sentinel Art Project

In 1980 Tom Van Sant made a piece of art [visible from space](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/article/a-big-eye-in-the-mojave-desert/) in the Mojave Desert.

Back then they used 60x60cm mirrors to saturate a LandSat 3's pixels, to create a piece of art 3km wide.

They only had one attempt per few days, and to angle the mirrors perfectly they had to drive 30km into the nearest town and call NASA for the updated satellite location data.

Today, we can create an automated network of mirrors to create a fluid and changing piece of art, visible only from the Sentinel 2 satellite.

Maybe.

This blog is about me trying.
